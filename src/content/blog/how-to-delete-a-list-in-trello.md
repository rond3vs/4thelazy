For a bum like you, exercise and reading at the same time can sound horrible, but there’s so much value in reading books—you should want to stay focused while reading.

We all know the cycle. You zone out, then have to reread the whole page. This doesn’t help at all when you procrastinated and need to read an assignment before school or are truly trying to learn something.

Then to top it all off, socials and shows don’t help. Imagine all the important things you can learn and implement in your own life if you focus properly. Maybe it’s not that you *can’t* focus—but the book sucks. What if you *need* to read it, for example, a textbook?

## Start with why

As with everything, you should first start with why. For example, [why are you lazy](https://4thelazy.com/why-am-i-lazy/)? Why are you reading this book? What are you trying to learn from it? Are you reading because you like the story, or is this book needed for work or school?

## Set constraints

To start, aim to read a certain amount of pages or for a certain amount of time every day. Make it attainable so you can stay consistent. The easier it is to start, the easier it is to continue.

Maybe it’s 10 pages a day, one page a day, or 20 minutes—whatever works. The goal is to start small, then scale up.

If page limits don’t work, try time. Your brain can focus better when it knows there’s a set window. Start with 10 minutes, then work your way up to 30+ minutes. Take breaks every hour.

## Remove Distractions

Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Netflix, YouTube. They’re all [distractions](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/workplace-distractions/). The closer they are, the easier it is to get sidetracked.

Put your phone in another room. Find a quiet place. No notifications. No noise. That’s how you get focused and stay focused.

## Use a guide

Your guide can be anything—pen, highlighter, ruler, bookmark. Use it to follow along under each line as you read. Without one, your eyes may wander and you'll zone out.

Guides keep your reading focused and can help you retain more information.

## Take notes

Taking notes is one of the best ways to stay focused while reading. Use a pen or pencil and jot down highlights or key ideas. Just like in school, writing things down reinforces memory.

It doesn’t matter if you’re reading nonfiction or a novel—note-taking works across the board.

## Use Rewards

Figure out what motivates you. Social media? Snacks? Movies?

Set a reward system. After one page or chapter, let yourself check Twitter or grab a cookie.

Make sure the reward is small and has limits. Scrolling for hours isn’t a reward—it’s a trap. A small snack or 5-minute break? That works.

## Final Thoughts

Try these methods or mix and match to find what works best for you.

Reading is food for your brain. Put TikTok down for a little bit—it’ll still be there when you’re done. If you’re too busy to read, audiobooks are a great and easier alternative.

Just start. Focus will follow.
