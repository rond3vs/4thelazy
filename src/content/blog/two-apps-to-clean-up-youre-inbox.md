Every time I open my phone I see a little red notification above my Gmail app saying I have 10,000+ unread emails.

I have a bad habit of submitting my email everywhere, but now my email is filled with newsletters, promos, subscriptions and spam.

So I found two apps that did what I wanted. The rest of the services cost too much and I don’t need anything like that, I just need a quick fix.

With just one of these apps you can get the job done if you really wanted to because it does it all.

## [Chuck - Smarter Email](https://chuck.email)

### What it is

Chuck is an app for IOS that allows you to clean out your email inbox with minimal effort. With chuck you can go through thousands of emails in under 30 minutes.

There is a free version and pro version called Chuck Pro. With Chuck PRO you can use Chuck with multiple email accounts.

### What it does

Chuck helps your group your emails by sender so you can go through your inbox even faster.

Chuck allows you to bulk delete, archive or sort through your emails with one tap. Filter how you want to delete your emails. Delete them by the sender, subject, or even time.

With Chuck you can also unsubscribe from those annoying recurring emails. Truly a power house when it comes to cleaning out your email inbox.

### Where to get it

The downside to this app is that it is only available for IOS devices.

You can get Chuck from the Appstore and use it on your any of your Apple devices.

## [Unroll Me](https://unroll.me)

### What it is

Unroll Me is the other free app. It is another free email management tool.

It doesn’t delete or archive emails unlike Chuck, but this app is mainly used for your subscriptions in your inbox.

The app is fast and easy to use so bums like us don’t have to struggle.

### What it does

Manage your subscriptions with one click. Unroll.Me will show you all your emails you are subscribed to and you can instantly unsubscribe from them.

In addition to this, Unroll Me offers what they call “The Rollup”.

This feature lets you combine your favorite emails like newsletters into one digestible email.

### Where to get it

You can download Unroll.Me from either the Apple App Store or Google Play.

If you only need one to clean out your inbox you can just use Chuck to handle it. With Chuck it does everything Unroll Me does except “The Rollup” function.

These two apps are by far the fastest to sort through your email and you know it’s time to go get that inbox under control.

Take back what’s your and use either of these two apps to clean out your inbox.

Turn that 10,000+ inbox into a manageable organized email.
