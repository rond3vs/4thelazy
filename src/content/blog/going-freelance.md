# Going freelance guide

Thinking about freelancing but don't want the hassle? Here's how to make the transition as painless as possible.

## Step 1: Start part-time

Keep your day job while you build up clients. This gives you income security while you test the waters.

## Step 2: Set up the basics

- Create a simple one-page website
- Set up a business email
- Choose one social platform to focus on
- Get a basic contract template

## Step 3: Find your first clients

The lazy (smart) way to find clients:
- Ask friends and former colleagues
- Join online communities where your potential clients hang out
- Leverage existing relationships instead of cold pitching

## Step 4: Establish simple systems

- Use a template for client onboarding
- Set up automated invoicing
- Create project management templates

Remember, you don't need to do everything at once. Start with the essentials and add complexity only when you need it.
