## Tips For Better Pancakes

Resting the batter for at least five minutes before cooking helps the gluten in it to release and become more tender and light. Doing this also allows the batter to become more fluffy and light to make more fluffy pancakes.

While oil is important in your pancake-making process, butter will also add more flavor to your dish. You can start by melting it first, then coating it in a kitchen towel. You don't want to shallow-fry your pan as butter can burn quickly. If you prefer to use oil, use a oil such as peanut or sunflower. Heat up the pan until it reaches a medium temperature before adding the batter.
