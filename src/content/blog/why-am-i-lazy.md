You know what you have to do, but still can’t muster up the energy or focus to do it? Have a whole day to yourself to get things done, but end up not doing a dang thing? Here’s a secret. Everybody struggles with laziness. You can be the hardest working individual and you’ll feel lazy at some point.

If we’re being honest, you most likely aren’t lazy. You are just avoiding the task at hand. Aka procrastinating.

The real question you should be asking yourself, is what is making you lazy? Where is this lack of motivation coming from?

Laziness can be a real burden sometimes when you have dreams, goals, and aspirations. Even more of a burden when you don’t know what to tackle.

So in this article let us find some causes of why you’re lazy. The only way to get rid of any problem is to stop it at the source.

## You have a fear of failure

Subconsciously, you’re thinking, “If I don’t start or finish, I can’t fail”. If you find yourself avoiding problems, finishing projects, or starting on a task, you have a fear of failure. Get over that fear of failure immediately. Rip it off like a band-aid. The quicker you face your fears the quicker you can things out the way and focus on what you really want to. Maybe Twitter?

## Lack of Interest

This happens with school and jobs. We show up, do the bare minimum, because that sh*t is boring! Why wouldn’t you be lazy? The thing you're doing sucks. Your best option is to find what excites you and do that. It may be a little scary at first trying to find what you want to do, but would you rather show up to do something you hate?

## Low energy

If you find yourself not wanting to do anything, you might have low energy. This can be due to lack of sleep or what you eat. Try to build a better sleeping routine to get at least a full 8 hours. If that doesn’t work, write down what you’re eating. Cut out the junk food, and track yourself. There are many apps to help you!

## Stress/Overwhelmed

Do you ever try to get productive by taking on multiple tasks at once? Then when you have to do it again now you don’t feel like doing it because you know how much work it will take. Laziness can be due to you being stressed or overwhelmed. Like, studying for a test, cleaning, or going to work. In your mind, you have this idea that it’s going to suck or be harder than what it actually is. There’s a trick you can try. You can try to apply the five-minute rule. Next time tell yourself that you’ll only do five minutes. Most likely when you get started you’ll end up doing more and realizing whatever you are avoiding isn’t that bad.

## Depression

Your mental health can be causing your laziness. Laziness is sometimes a sign of depression. If you feel like you have depression, it’s alright to get medical help. See a therapist find the root cause of your depression.

Being lazy isn’t for everyone. The way to fix a problem is to find the root cause of it. Take some time to yourself and work on yourself. The best investment you can make is in your education and your health.
