We've all been there. I had a routine and a to-do list for the day, but then laziness got in the way.

I could have the whole day with no other priorities and still get nothing done. Every once in a while, this isn't bad, but over and over again is bound to frustrate you.

One day you say you'll do it later, and then the next thing you know, you've procrastinated a whole week, then a month, and even years. That is one example. You aren't lazy; you have lazy habits, and to stop, you have to be aware of what you're doing. So here are some habits that lazy people have.

## 1. Procrastination

Procrastination is the big one. Everybody procrastinates at some point in their life, but lazy people do it more than the rest.

Now patience is an excellent thing in life, but you should be proactive whenever you can when it comes to getting things done. Procrastination is such a detrimental habit to have. If there is one habit to break immediately, it should be this one!

## 2. Sleeping In

Sleep is essential, but sleeping in till noon is a problem. Your whole day is gone, and now you have to sleep again. Unless that was your plan? I get it—that snooze button is such a blessing sometimes. After the 7th time of hitting it, now it may have become a bad habit.

Now you're late for work, school, and you missed breakfast—all for a little more sleep. Sleeping in late is another habit that lazy people tend to have. I'm not saying become an early bird or not get your total 8 hours of sleep. Focus on that. I'm saying aim to make waking up on time the new habit.

## 3. Make Excuses

- "Alarm didn't go off."
- "My phone died."
- "I was watching *Euphoria*."
- "I forgot."

All these excuses—if you manage your time better, you won’t need them. Making excuses is not the way to go in life. From one bum to another, this is a horrible habit. Some things come up in life, but people can recognize this bad habit coming from you a mile away. Make this your second-priority bad habit to break as a lazy person.

## 4. Too Much Time With Distractions

Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook, etc... There's so much distraction! HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu! Removing distractions is hard, especially since it's every form of entertainment you could ask for, everywhere you look. This is one habit everyone needs to break from—not only lazy people. I can't even lie; this may be the hardest one.

So many funny memes; how could your boss get mad at you for not doing your job? It's not a bad thing to watch or be on social media all day, but you know what they say: "everything is good in moderation." Some of you put in whole 8-hour shifts on social media and don't make any money off it (myself included). Instead, use entertainment as a reward for when you get things done. Try to turn this bad habit into more of a reward for yourself.

## 5. Starting New Projects and Not Finishing

So many ideas! That's what happens when you're on the couch all day. I've been there. Started a project, but then a new idea pops in your head, and you have to jump on it. You say to yourself, "I'll come back to it," or "I can do both at the same time." Then no project ends up getting finished. Now you have everybody asking, *"Have you finished that one project yet?"* and you respond, *"No."*

That's alright because now you know it's a habit (mixed in with a little bit of fear of failure and FOMO).

You're now aware of what you're doing. Next time, start small, stay consistent on ONE project, and build up from there. We think we can manage more than one project at a time, but that's rarely the case. Step by step, little by little, and you will get there.

As with any habit, they can break. I'm not saying that you are lazy because you have these habits; you can have only one of them and not be lazy. Even hardworking people struggle with some of these, if not all of them. I know as a lazy person you don't want to hear this, but it's going to take some work. *Yuck,* I know—but you got it. The first step to break habits is to be aware of them first.
