## Grab Your Supplies

For this best solution to clean bird poop off your car windows, you'll just need a few simple household items.

Grab something to spray on it. Preferably a cleaning solution. It could even be club soda or seltzer water too. The carbonated water is key for helping break down and remove those dried-on bird bombs.

You'll want a spray bottle to apply the solution to the affected area. Any clean bottle will work, or you can pick a designated glass cleaner spray bottle.

You'll also need some good clean clothes for wiping. Microfiber cloths are the best choice as they are lint-free and won't cause tiny scratches. Depending on the paper towel, they can scratch your paint if you’re not careful. Grab a few so you have fresh cloths as needed. Some paper towels are also handy to have for drying.

If you're dealing with some hardened and dried bird poop, it's a good idea to get a plastic scraper too. This will let you lift off crusty droppings before using the cleaning solution.

## The Cleaning Process

Time to get that bird poop cleaned up before it can cause any permanent damage or ugly water spots.

Start by giving the affected area a good spray down with the solution straight from the spray bottle.

Let it soak in to start breaking down that sticky bird excrement.

Then, take one of your clean microfiber cloths and wipe to lift off as much of the drop wipes as you can. Don't scrub too aggressively though. You want to avoid potential scratching to your car's clear coat or glass.

Once you've wiped away as much as possible, go over it again with a damp cloth and some clean water to do a final rinse. Buff it dry using a paper towel or another clean microfiber towel.

If it’s a crusty mess, use that plastic scraper first. Lift and remove as much of the hardened bird poop as you can. Then follow the same process – spray, wipe, rinse, and dry.

## Other Tips and Tricks

If it won't budge, try making a cleaning solution with equal parts warm water and white vinegar. The vinegar will help further break down and dissolve those bird poop stains.

Spray this vinegar solution liberally onto the affected area. Let it soak for a few minutes before wiping it with a clean cloth. You may need to do a few rounds of spraying and wiping to fully remove it. The vinegar is gentle enough that it won't cause any paint damage.

For Lingering faint stains or water spots, try using a quick detailer spray designed for cars. Spray it onto the areas and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The detailer contains mild cleaners that can help lift those last traces.

Your best bet may be doing a full car wash with the two-bucket method and car shampoo. Use the wash mitt to gently clean the windows along with the rest of the vehicle's surface.

Avoid anything with harsh abrasives or acids that could damage your car's paint job or protective coatings.

## Prevent Future Bird Bombings

There’s always a good chance those pesky birds will try to foul up your ride again.

If possible:

Park undercover like a carport, garage, or covered parking area.

Using a car cover or tarp.

Look into buying some bird-repellent products made for vehicles.

These may use reflectors, sounds, smells or other deterrents. This can make birds avoid that area.

Some people have had luck hanging up fake owls or other bird decoys near their parking spot.

Ceramic coatings or high-quality synthetic sealants can also make your car's surface. Now you’re windows less appealing targets for bird droppings by being easier to rinse clean.

## Why Birds Poop on Car Windows

There are a few main reasons this unsavory issue occurs.

First up, the surface of your car's windows creates a smooth, warm surface. This can resemble a rock or ground area that birds instinctively view as an ideal place to do business.

Additionally, birds don't have the same sense of territory that might stop other animals from pooping somewhere. To them, your car is simply in their way when nature calls.

The color of your car can also play a role. Lighter-colored vehicles seem to attract more bird bombings. Possibly because the contrast makes the car more visible from above.

They’re jerks.

The good news is that with some deterrent tactics and prompt cleaning, you can combat the problem!

## A Note on Safety

The club soda and vinegar solutions are effective at removing bird poop. Without damaging your car's finish. There's one area you'll want to take extra caution - your windshield wipers and wiper blades.

The sharp grains and acidic nature can pit, stain, or etch the rubber window rubbers and wiper blades. It’s best to remove the poop as soon as possible.

Use just plain water and a soft cloth to gently wipe away any bird poop on the wiper blades and window rubbers. Avoid using the cleaning solutions on these rubber surfaces. It could cause premature deterioration or cracking.

We've focused a lot on keeping your car's glass and paint free from bird poop damage. But don't forget about those UPVC window frames and trims! Bird droppings can also stain and degrade these plastic surfaces over time.
