If you aren’t using shortcuts, then you are using your iPhone wrong. Simple as that. They can be a iPhone user’s best friend. There’s so much untapped potential with shortcuts.

## What are Shortcuts?

Shortcuts are the future of the iPhone. Shortcuts are one of the features introduced in IOS 12. You can use them to automate tasks on your phone. With shortcuts you can set multiple alarms simultaneously, eject water out of your phone, and turn your Wi-Fi in a QR code. Shortcuts have many possibilities, and you can create your own shortcut if you wanted to.

So here’s a list of top tier shortcuts you must-have for your iPhone:

## QR WIFI

“What’s the WiFi password?”

"What's the WiFi?

We've all heard this before. Then you have to get up and look at the bottom of your router and give them the WiFi password. Now you're slowly typing the WiFi password in their phone carefully making sure you didn't make a mistake. If you have an iPhone it may be different you're able to share WiFi with another apple product.

Now with this shortcut, all you have to do is enter your Wi-Fi name and password and the shortcut will automatically turn into a QR code. Let's say you have a few people over and they need the wifi password, just turn it into a QR code and let your guest scan your phone. Ten times better than getting up from the couch and looking for the password.

## DTwitter

I don't know why Twitter doesn't let you save videos, but luckily there are people out there that have our backs. So many memes and funny videos on Twitter that sometimes it's only right that you save them to your camera roll. Add them to your arsenal of memes or just save them later for yourself.

## Set Some Alarms

Set multiple alarms at the same time at whatever interval you want. We all set multiple alarms so we get up on time, but setting each one, one by one takes too much time. Use this shortcut to choose how many alarms you want to be set and then how many minutes in between them.

## Dictate to Notes

Have you had an idea or thought that you quickly needed to write down in your notes, but let’s be honest, we're too lazy to open up the notes app? Yeah, that’s where this shortcut comes into play.

Dictate to Notes records what you say and automatically adds it to the iPhone notes app. Save that quick thought or idea automatically in your notes app and come back to it later.

## Delete Last Photo

I hate when I accidentally screenshot something on my phone. Then either I forget or I am too lazy to delete it. This shortcut comes in handy all the time for me. I don't know how I get so many random screenshots in my phone. With this shortcut I can finally quickly delete them and never have to worry about it again. You can even set it to delete more than one recent photos.

## Speed Dial

Create your own speed dial. This is way faster than using favorites in the contacts app or using siri. Since most of us only regularly call like 2-3 people, add them to your speed dial.

## Find Gas (or Anything)

![Find Gas Shortcut](https://4thelazy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Friday-07-Jan-2022-201714-508x1024.png)

Instead of typing in maps "nearest gas station" use can just click this shortcut and it will automatically bring up a list of gas station nearest to you. The best part about this, is that you can set this to whatever you like. Set it up so you can find the nearest restaurants, gas stations, hospitals, etc..

## PiP Youtube

Place Youtube videos in Pictures-in-Picture mode. Now you can scroll social media and watch YouTube at the same time. Just like you can with FaceTime, you can do the same. This does require you to download the Scriptable app from the App Store, but its free!

## Time Travel to Address

Pretty self explanatory. Get the water out of your speakers with this shorcut. This uses your iPhone's speakers to generate a certain frequency to vibrate the water out of your phone.

## Reverse Image Search

If you have an image and want to know where it came from or if you’re getting catfished use this shortcut. Download the image and let technology do the rest. If google can't find it then you're out of luck.

These are the best shortcuts I have found. Shortcuts are the next wave in my opinion. Unlike apps where they want you to sign up with email, and then make an account, Shortcuts just let you use them. No sign up or anything. No email notifications, just straight vibes. If you like this please share it with someone who you think can benefit from this post!
