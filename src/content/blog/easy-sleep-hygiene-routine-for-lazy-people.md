Sleeplessness is increasing exponentially. Most of us experience disrupted sleep, a lethargic body, dizziness during the day, and unwanted anxiety. All this is due to our happy-go-lucky attitude towards sleep.

Ideal sleep can work wonders. This is where **Sleep Hygiene** kicks in. Sleep hygiene refers to the various habits and lifestyle changes we can adopt to get restful, uninterrupted sleep. By following some simple do's and don'ts, we can enjoy deep, refreshing sleep.

## Benefits of Sleep

**Good Overall Health**  
Most of you night owls are familiar with sleep disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea. In fact, 25% of Americans face insomnia every year. Poor sleep increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease. The fix? Stress less and sleep more.

**Keeps Your Immune System Healthy**  
Got sick again? Overworking and under-sleeping weakens your immune system. Aim for at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep to keep sickness away.

**More Productive Hours**  
When you're sleep-deprived, the simplest task can take forever. Sleep improves focus, efficiency, and memory—making your day smoother and more productive.

**Eliminates Laziness**  
Laziness often hides stress and mental fatigue. Even if you’re laying down all day, your body isn’t recharging properly. Good sleep refreshes your body and mind.

**Increases Positivity**  
Waking up well-rested leads to better moods, higher energy, and a more optimistic mindset.

**Maintains Body Weight**  
Gaining weight without eating more? Lack of sleep can confuse your brain into craving carbs. Sleep more to keep hunger hormones in check.

## The Easy Sleep Hygiene Routine

### 1. Set a Bedtime

Go to sleep at the same time every night. Your body needs a schedule. Pick a bedtime that allows for at least 8 hours of sleep and stick to it—even on weekends.

### 2. Have a Pre-Sleep Schedule

Don’t go straight from work to bed. Wind down for 15–20 minutes first. Try:

- **Warm Bath** – Helps your body relax and fall asleep faster.  
- **Limit Fluids** – Avoid too many drinks before bed to prevent nighttime bathroom trips.  
- **Short Naps Only** – Long naps during the day mess up your night sleep.  
- **Avoid Evening Caffeine** – Skip that coffee or soda 6 hours before bed.

### 3. Create a Sleep-Inducing Environment

Just like you prep for a workout or meal, prep your space for sleep:

- **Mattress & Bedding** – Cozy and supportive.  
- **Lavender Scent** – Known to reduce insomnia and improve sleep quality.  
- **Night Lights** – Use red light instead of blue. Red light supports melatonin production.  
- **Room Temperature** – Keep it cool around 20°C (68°F). Too hot or cold can wake you up.

### 4. Turn Off Electronics

No screens before bed. Seriously. Try a screen-free hour if possible.

- **Turn Off Phones & TVs** – Put them in another room if needed.  
- **Blue-Light Glasses** – If you must use screens, use blue-light blockers.

### 5. Do a Calming Activity

Wind down with something peaceful:

- **Read a Book** – Reduces stress and improves mood.  
- **Listen to Calm Music** – Healing sounds can soothe you into sleep.  
- **Meditate** – Deep breathing helps calm your mind and body.  
- **Cooling Eye Mask** – Soothes eyes and improves sleep quality.
