## Why One-Pot Meals Win

1. **Fewer dishes**: Only one thing to wash when you're done
2. **Set and forget**: Most active cooking time is under 15 minutes
3. **Better flavor**: Ingredients mingle and develop deeper taste

## Weeknight Heroes

### Slow Cooker Pulled Pork
Dump pork shoulder, BBQ sauce, onions, and spices in your slow cooker. Set for 8 hours on low. Shred with forks when done. That's 8 episodes of anything you want.

### Dutch Oven Chicken Thighs
Brown chicken thighs, add potatoes, carrots, broth, and herbs. Cover and bake at 350°F for 45 minutes. Just enough time for one movie.

### Sheet Pan Sausage & Veggies
Toss sliced sausage, bell peppers, onions, and potatoes with olive oil and seasoning. Roast at 425°F for 25 minutes. Perfect for a quick episode.

## Lazy Person Pantry Essentials

* Canned beans and tomatoes
* Boxed broth (any kind)
* Pre-minced garlic (we won't tell anyone)
* Frozen vegetables
* Spice blends (fewer jars to open)

## The "I Have Nothing in My Kitchen" Emergency Meal

Combined pasta, canned tomatoes, olive oil, and any cheese you have in a pot. Add water, boil until pasta is cooked and water is absorbed. Season with whatever's in your spice drawer. Done in 15 minutes flat.

## Meal Prep Magic

Make double portions. Eat leftovers tomorrow. Now you've bought yourself two nights of Netflix without cooking.

Pro tip: Most of these meals actually taste better the next day when flavors have had more time to develop.

Let the food work while you don't. That's the true definition of working smarter, not harder.
