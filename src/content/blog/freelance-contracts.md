## The Dos

1. **Do use a template**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Find a solid contract template and customize it.
2. **Do specify payment terms**: Always be clear about when and how you'll get paid.
3. **Do include a kill fee**: If the client cancels, you should still get compensated for time spent.

## The Don'ts

1. **Don't skip written agreements**: Even for small jobs, get it in writing.
2. **Don't forget to specify deliverables**: Be crystal clear about what you're providing.
3. **Don't ignore copyright terms**: Make sure you know who owns the work when it's done.

Remember, a good contract protects both you and the client. It's worth the small effort upfront to avoid big headaches later.
