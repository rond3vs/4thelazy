Six months ago, my digital life was a chaotic mess. 147 desktop icons. 230+ browser bookmarks. 17 productivity apps. Countless notifications interrupting my day. I was drowning in digital clutter while ironically downloading more apps promising to help me stay organized.

Then I discovered digital minimalism and deleted almost everything. Here's what happened.

## The Great Digital Purge

### What I Deleted:
- 16 of my 17 productivity apps
- 90% of my desktop shortcuts
- 200+ bookmarks I never used
- 80% of my social media accounts
- All notifications except calls and messages from real humans
- 15,000+ emails (yes, really)

## The Results Were Immediate

### 1. My focus returned
Within days, I could concentrate for 90+ minute stretches without the phantom urge to check notifications. My brain literally felt different—clearer and calmer.

### 2. I saved shocking amounts of time
Between app-hopping, notification-checking, and endlessly organizing my digital "stuff," I was wasting nearly 3 hours daily. Those hours are now mine again.

### 3. Decision fatigue vanished
No more debating which note-taking app to use or which task manager was "optimal." With fewer options, I made decisions faster and with more confidence.

## The Minimalist Digital Setup That Actually Works

### The Core System:
- **One note-taking app** (plain text only)
- **One calendar** (ruthlessly guarded)
- **One task manager** (the simpler the better)
- **One cloud storage solution**
- **Two-folder email system** (inbox and archive—that's it)

### The Rules:
1. **If it doesn't bring immediate value, delete it**
2. **Create nothing that requires ongoing maintenance**
3. **No notifications except from actual humans**
4. **Digital cleanup every Friday (15 minutes max)**

## What I Learned

Digital minimalism isn't about suffering or technological regression. It's about intentionality. Every app, notification, and digital service demands a piece of your attention—and attention is the most valuable currency we have.

By eliminating digital excess, I didn't just declutter my devices—I decluttered my mind. And in that newfound mental space, I rediscovered something I hadn't experienced in years: the ability to think deeply and create freely, without the constant digital hum of distraction.
