## The Dos (For When You *Barely* Want to Do Anything)

1. **Do use a template:**  
   Why reinvent the wheel when you can copy-paste someone else's hard work? Grab a solid contract template, make the minimal tweaks, and call it a day—your couch awaits.

2. **Do specify payment terms:**  
   Clearly state when and how you'll get paid. That way, you won't have to drag yourself off the sofa to chase down payments later. Money in, nap time guaranteed!

3. **Do include a kill fee:**  
   If the client decides to bail mid-project (or you hit snooze on the job), make sure you're still compensated. Even if you're lazy, you deserve a little extra for not doing much.

## The Don'ts (Because Even Lazy Folks Have Standards)

1. **Don't skip written agreements:**  
   Sure, verbal promises might be easier, but they can lead to headaches down the road. Get it in writing—even if it means a tiny bit of extra effort now, you'll save yourself from a marathon email chain later.

2. **Don't forget to specify deliverables:**  
   Spell out exactly what you’re providing. That way, if you do end up working on something, everyone’s on the same page without you having to explain yourself repeatedly.

3. **Don't ignore copyright terms:**  
   Sort out who owns the work when it’s done. It’s the lazy person’s secret to avoiding extra follow-up discussions and potential disputes.

Even if your motto is “work smarter, not harder,” a good contract is your ticket to peace of mind. Take a few moments now, and you'll have fewer headaches—and more time for that well-deserved nap!
